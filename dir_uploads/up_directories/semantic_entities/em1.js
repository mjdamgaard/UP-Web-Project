// First entity module (EM) with some initial entities, not least the
// 'Entities' class and the 'Classes' class which are fundamental to the
// whole semantic system.




// Class of all things, all "entities." Entities are defined/represented by
// objects of the kind you see below, namely with capitalized property names,
// and always with a "Class" property. We will tend to refer to these defining
// properties of entities as their "attributes."
// It should be noted that all these "attributes" of an entity are not set in
// stone. Any attribute can be overridden by what we can call "scored
// properties," which are properties determined by the users when they score
// the "relations" that are introduced below. So all the attributes that you
// see below are in principle only the "initial" or "default" ones, possibly.
// And their job is thus only to specify what thing or concept is being
// referred to, as well as possibly to declare some metadata properties that
// the app might use as default options.
// Entities will often refer to a real-world things or concepts, or a things or
// concepts relating to this semantic and/or user-programmable system. But they
// can also be self-contained objects that just refers to themselves. Such
// objects will often carry "methods" as part of their attributes, the names for
// which we will tend to use lower camel case (as in e.g. "fetchScoreData"),
// making these entities able to be treated similarly to objects from an OOP
// language.
// The values of the attributes can be anything such as strings and numbers,
// and methods as just mentioned, and can also paths leading to such data. And
// most importantly, they can be the "keys" of other entities. Such entity keys
// can either be paths to the entity's definition object (as seen e.g. for all
// "Class" attributes defined below), or they can be strings of the form
// '#<entID>' or just '<entID>', where entID (entity ID) is a hexadecimal
// string that is assigned to the entity when uploading it via the
// ./entities.sm.js server module. They can also be of the form '@<userID>',
// where userID is the hexadecimal string that the backend uses in order to
// identify users.
// The kind of values to expect for each attributes and their interpretations
// should be defined by the class's description. But unless otherwise specified,
// it should be the convention to escape '#' and '@' characters in string-
// valued attributes, as well as leading '/'s, using backslashes for doing so,
// unless these are to be interpreted as part of an entity key and/or a path.

// Areas of concern can furthermore also be used as a way to achieve almost
// perfect user anonymity while at the same time being able to assign trust to
// anonymous users. Here's how that can work. The system is made open towards
// creating several user profiles with the same e-mail address, and this is so
// for a reason. We want users to create several profiles, namely for different
// areas of concern. A user can then have a sort of "main" profile, either a
// public one, which can be confirmed as a real person via a friend-of-a-friend
// (FoaF) network (similar to Facebook and what have you, and Facebook might
// potentially be used for this FoaF network to some extend), or the "main" user
// profile can also be a private one that is nonetheless able to garner trust
// among the user network. But regardless of whether your "main" profile is
// public or not, you don't necessarily want it connected to all your other
// opinions about everything. Be it political opinions or opinions about
// sensitive things like pornography and sexual matter. Or you might want a
// private account to share and discuss secrets and/or private experiences with
// others. Or you even just might not want, say, your boss and your coworkers,
// and everyone else that you know, to know all your tastes in movies, free-time
// activities, and all other things.
// But if you just create a new anonymous profile for this, how will people
// know that you are not just a bot (a concern that is more relevant than ever
// with AI bots taking over the web)? Well, they can if you connect the new
// profile privately (using private data tables) to your main profile, with
// respect to a given user group, such that others only get to see that the new
// profile is connected to *some* profile that is part of the given user group,
// and what approximate weight that profile has in that user group (they can't
// know the precise wight as that might out the exact profile).
// This can indeed be achieved, but then comes the question: How to prevent
// users from just creating a horde of other profiles in order to boost their
// opinions in the network? By making sure that the new profiles can't score
// the same qualities as the "main"  profile or any of the other profiles that
// is connected to it. And that is what the 'areas of concern' is used for in
// this regard. Each profile needs to select a set of areas of concern,
// possibly just one, when it connects to other profiles this way. And the
// areas of concern will be publicly known for each profile such that the user
// community can make sure that the profile does not score something that is
// unrelated to those areas, or just not aggregate the scores if they are.
// And when the user profiles connect with a "main" profile, you make sure to
// store the selected areas of concern, and make sure they don't overlap with
// any of the ones that are already chosen, by the "main" profile or by others
// that has previously been connected to it.
// And how to decide if two areas overlap? Simply by querying a 'Overlaps with'
// relation (with some appropriate user group to decide this), and checking
// that the score here is below a certain threshold (and with a high enough
// combined weight).
// And there we go, this is how users can get near perfect anonymity, while
// still making it possible for the user network to prevent bots posing as
// humans to a very great extend, and from users duplicating their scores.
// (And the UP node will of course also sign contracts not to read private data
// such as the data stored for connecting the profiles, now and in the future,
// and even if they are somehow not able to sign such contracts, there are
// still encryption schemes that you can implement to make sure that they also
// can't read the data, namely where the user holds an encryption key to the
// data.)
