// TODO: This component should at some point be extended with a menu for
// changing the sorting and filtering options. And it should maybe also at some
// point get an API that allows it to push browser history states such that
// the currently focussed entity can be scrolled to automatically again when
// the page reloads (after we have also implemented such scroll actions/methods
// (unless wanting to implement it in another way))..

// TODO: This sorting/filtering/search should not least include an option to
// see the "new" entities (those without a weight above 10), and/or see the
// entities with a negative score (when dealing with the 'Predicate metric').

// By the way, another todo, which is not about this component directly, is
// to extend and enhance our scoreHandler such that we don't just use the
// second-hand trusted user group for everything. In particular we should use
// a more carefully governed user group for UI safety (used to prevent
// phishing attempts, and such).

// TODO: The "Add entity" menu should be changed for all lists where the
// "Subject class" of the relation is or is a subset of the 'Texts' class, such
// that for these lists, the user can add a comment directly.




// This component takes either a quality, a relation--object pair, or a class,
// and renders a list of entities fetched either from the provided quality, or
// from the relational quality formed by either the relation--object pair, or
